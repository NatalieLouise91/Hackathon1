# Trivia Master

## Overview

An application that generates a list of trivia questions based on the amount of questions, category and difficulty that the user selects

## About The Application

It's Wednesday night, time to don your best patterned button up, comb your moustache and head on down to the local pub where you host weekly trivia. As you compile your list of teams partaking this evening, you note those with particularly excellent names: "Menace to Sobriety" and "Quiz Me Baby One More Time".
The thing is, after a few weeks, you are on struggle street trying to come up with questions. That's where Trivia Masters comes in. We help you generate a list of questions (and answers) to host a couple of hours of good times. Don't like the results? Regenerate, baby!
